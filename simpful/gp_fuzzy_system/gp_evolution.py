To-Do List for Refining gp_evolution.py:

1. Explore and Implement More Advanced Selection Strategies:
   - Research and possibly integrate more sophisticated selection methods (e.g., tournament selection, ranked selection) that could better fit the dynamics of evolving fuzzy systems.

2. Refine Crossover and Mutation Logic:
   - Based on the lessons from the previous implementation, further develop the crossover and mutation functions to ensure they effectively promote diversity and innovation in the rule sets.

3. Introduce Elitism:
   - To ensure the preservation of the best solutions across generations, implement an elitism strategy that carries over a certain percentage of the top performers to the next generation.

4. Dynamic Mutation Rates:
   - Consider introducing dynamic mutation rates that adjust based on the evolution progress, potentially increasing exploration in early generations and exploitation in later stages.

5. Parallel Processing for Fitness Evaluation:
   - Given the potentially computationally intensive process of evaluating each individual's fitness, explore parallelizing these operations to improve efficiency and scalability.

6. Comprehensive Termination Conditions:
   - Beyond a fixed number of generations, implement additional termination criteria, such as convergence to a fitness threshold or lack of improvement over several generations.

7. Logging and Analysis Tools:
   - Develop mechanisms for detailed logging of the evolutionary process and tools for analyzing the performance and characteristics of evolved systems over generations.

Each item on this list aims to build upon the initial implementation, drawing inspiration from previous work while focusing on the unique challenges of evolving fuzzy systems for regression tasks, such as Bitcoin price prediction.
